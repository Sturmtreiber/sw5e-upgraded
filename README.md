# SW5E Game System for Foundry VTT (Independent Continuation)

⚠️ **Important Notice**  
This repository is an **independent continuation** of the original SW5E Foundry VTT system,  
maintained and further developed by **a single passionate fan** of SW5E and Foundry VTT.

The original system was discontinued by its previous maintainers.  
This fork exists to keep the SW5E system **usable and up to date for modern Foundry VTT versions (V12+)**.
